# harmony-now (!)

this library is meant to be required before anything else.
it's intended to polyfill harmony features missing for various v8 versions.

### Proxy

working :)

### TODO

 - enumerate all node versions using travis matrix and get all polyfills necessary.
 - other things.

for now though, it fulfills my requirements.
